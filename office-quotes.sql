The sun? Maybe there\'s some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just&#8230; the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah&#8230; the body of a porcupine. \nJim: I will do some research.\nPam: I can help you with that.','a:4:{i:0;s:7:\"Michael\";i:1;s:5:\"Kelly\";i:3;s:3:\"Jim\";i:4;s:3:\"Pam\";}'),

You should put your mouth on that.
